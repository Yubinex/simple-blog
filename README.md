# Simple Blog

> Note: This project was created as a part of my learning journey and is not intended for actual deployment. It represents my first experience building a web application with Ruby on Rails.

Welcome to **Simple Blog**!

This repository showcases the initial strides of my Ruby on Rails journey. As my inaugural project, it focuses on fundamental concepts of web development. Although not designed for real-world deployment, this simple blog project encapsulates key learnings and accomplishments on my path to mastering Ruby on Rails.

## Project Highlights

- **Learning Opportunity:** This project marks my introduction to web development using Ruby on Rails. It embodies my dedication to learning and showcases the progress I've made.

- **Basic Functionality:** While intentionally basic, the blog incorporates essential features such as creating, editing, and deleting posts. This solidifies my understanding of core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **Authentication Exploration:** Through the utilization of the Devise gem, I delved into the realm of user authentication. This experience paves the way for understanding secure user management.

- **Introduction to Rich Text:** By implementing a rich text editor, I dived into the realm of more complex form inputs. This foray into rich text prepares me for handling diverse user inputs.
